 ###Election Audit Summary
 
 Since this code is easily refactored, it can be used for further analysis in this election, and in different elections moving forward. You could provide a breakdown of votes per candidate by county to show candidate popularity by region. You could apply it on a larger scale to presidential elections, showing the total number of votes cast for each candidate in the country, then breaking it down by state. You could also apply it to city council elections by showing the candidates and candidatesâ€™ vote counts for each district. You could see each city district's results and compare between districts, seeing which ones have high or low turnout.
